dwindows (3.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed an API inconsistency in dw_notebook_page_destroy/set().
    The page ID had been unsigned int when it should be unsigned long.
    On some platforms apps compiled for versions prior to 3.3 may
    malfunction when calling these API calls, so recompile with 3.3.
  * Added tree widget/control support for iOS and Android.
  * Removed the lib and dll directories previously used on Windows and OS/2.
  * Added DW_FEATURE_CONTAINER_MODE on Mobile platforms: iOS and Android.
    DW_CONTAINER_MODE_DEFAULT: Minimal container; icon and text only.
    DW_CONTAINER_MODE_EXTRA: Extra columns displayed on a second line.
    DW_CONTAINER_MODE_MULTI: A separate clickable line for each column.
  * Added return values to several functions previously returning void.
    Previous code should just be able to ignore the new return values.
    Currently affected: dw_window_set_bitmap(_from_data)
  * Added C++ language bindings in dw.hpp and an example C++ test
    application in the form of dwtestoo.cpp, similar to godwindows.
  * Added variadic versions of dw_debug() and dw_messagebox().
    This is how the standard library does it so we can call the new
    va_list versions from C++: dw_vdebug() and dw_vmessagebox().
  * Added dw_pixmap_get_height() and dw_pixmap_get_width() APIs to
    replace the DW_PIXMAP_HEIGHT() and DW_PIXMAP_WIDTH() macros.
    This allows non-C bindings to call them directly.

    via GLib's G_APP_INFO_CREATE_NEEDS_TERMINAL instead of launching an xterm.
  * Fixed GTK warnings on GTK3 caused by using Pango style font syntax.
  * Fixed GTK3 leaks when setting fonts or colors on a widget repeatedly.
  * Fixed a bug in dw_listbox_set_text() on GTK3.

  * Improvements for building on 64bit Windows with MinGW.
    Window styles, HTML and Toolbar widgets are now supported.
  * Added dw_shutdown() for use when shutting down Dynamic Windows but not quite ready
    to exit immediately. (Functions like dw_exit() without the exit())
  * Separated the container "title" (string) and "data" (pointer) into separate spaces.
    The "classic" functions which take (char *) parameters now maintain their
    own string memory backing so you no longer need to keep the data available.
  * Removed dw_container_set_row_data() and dw_container_change_row_data() macros.
  * Added dw_container_set_row_data() and dw_container_change_row_data() functions.
  * Removed the "_dw_textcomp" container data flag, dw_container_cursor() and
    dw_container_delete_row() which take (char *) now function in text compare mode.
  * Added dw_container_cursor_by_data() and dw_container_delete_row_by_data() 
    functions which do the same things except in pointer comparison mode.
  * Added DW_CR_RETDATA flag to dw_container_query_*() functions to return the
    data pointer instead of the string pointer, this may change in the future.
  * Added exported internal functions _dw_init_thread() and _dw_deinit_thread()
    for language bindings to setup/cleanup threads created for DW use.
  * Fixed some memory leaks.
  * WARNING: Changed how tree and container titles are returned, they are now duplicated 
    and need to be freed with dw_free().  This affects the following functions:
    dw_tree_get_title(), dw_container_query_start() and dw_container_query_next()
    You should audit any code using these functions for leaks if using verison 3.

    Non-OS/2 native file formats. GBM comes with eCS 1.2 and later.
    It is also available at http://hobbes.nmsu.edu
  * Added resizing HICNs to 24x24 max size on platforms which do not 
    do it automatically (Mac and GTK). OS/2 and Windows limit the size.
  * Added toolbar control support to replace existing bitmap buttons on Windows.
  * Added dw_filesystem_set_column_title() to fill a hole in localization.

    This eliminates the need for the DW_BORDER_* environment variables.
  * Added Open Watcom compiler support for OS/2 (Thanks Andy Willis).
  * Added pseudo transparent background widget support on Windows and OS/2.
    If you set the background color of a widget to DW_RGB_TRANSPARENT...
    it will attempt to use the background color of the parent.
    Several types of widgets have this set by default now.
  * Added faster and less buggy layout engine 2.0 for OS/2, Windows and Mac.
  * Added auto-positioning on Mac; reimplemented auto-positioning on OS/2.
  * Added DW_DRAW_NOAA which can be passed to dw_draw_*() API functions

dwindows (2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added printing support via dw_print_new, dw_print_run and dw_print_cancel.
  * Added pixmap font override support. In prior versions when drawing
    text to pixmaps the font set on the associated window handle is used.
    dw_pixmap_set_font() can now override that font setting, and now
    pixmaps without associated windows are supported and used in printing.
  * Added dw_pixmap_stretch_bitblt() which allows for scaling during bitblt.
    This function is necessary largely for very hi-res printer contexts.   
  * Added dw_mutex_trylock() function to try to obtain a mutex without blocking.
  * Added DW_TIMEOUT_INFINITE which can now be used with dw_event_wait() in 
    addition to dw_named_event_wait(), to block until the event is posted.
  * Added DW_PERCENT_INDETERMINATE which can be passed to dw_percent_set_pos().
    This should work on all platforms except old versions of Windows. 
  * Added the subversion revision number as the third Dynamic Windows version 
    number when building from a subversion source tree.
  * Added dw_container_set_row_data() and dw_container_change_row_data() macros
    which just call dw_container_set/change_row_title() but with (void *).
  * Added dw_container_set_stripe() to set alternating row colors.
    Currently Mac, Win and GTK are supported.
  * Added taskbar support on the Mac, GTK (Gnome) and OS/2 (e/XCenter+Systray).
  * Added PNG/JPG/GIF/TIFF support on Windows via GDI+.
  * Added support for GdkPixbuf inline images in GTK 2 and 3.
  * Added dw_draw_arc() function for drawing arcs, ellipses and circles.
  * Added DW_DRAW_DEFAULT, DW_DRAW_FILL and DW_DRAW_FULL flags which can be passed
    to dw_draw_arc(), dw_draw_rect() and dw_draw_polygon().  The fill parameter
    in the latter two has been replaced with flags where DW_DRAW_FILL is the
    same as TRUE so code using the old scheme should still work unchanged.
  * Added DW_MENU_AUTO and DW_MENU_POPUP constants for autogenerating menu IDs.
  * Added dw_debug() function for sending debug messages to the console.
  * Added path and/or filename support to dw_file_browse() on OS/2, Windows,
    GTK2, GTK3 and Mac 10.6 or higher.
  * Added custom calendar widget for OS/2, leaving only the HTML widget missing.
  * Improved container optimization on Mac, header width now taken into account.
  * Fixes for incorrect return codes from the dw_event_* functions on Windows.
  * Fixes for incorrect behavior on key_press callbacks on Mac and Windows.
  * Fixes for MDI support in GTK3. 
  * Fixes for problems with multiple sliders/percent widgets in a box on OS/2.
  * Fixes for lots of GTK3 layout and window positioning issues... 
    although minimum size issues are still present.

dwindows (2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for MacOS 10.7 Lion, version 2.0 had some issues.
  * Changed the font point size on Windows to be system consistent.
    Applications setting Windows fonts may need to be adjusted
    after upgrading to version 2.1. This eliminates an old
    workaround, but causes old fonts to potentially be wrong.
  * Fixed issues with the tree widget on Mac not being able to add
    nodes at the same level with the same name.
  * Added dw_font_set_default() to set the default text widget font.
  * Added dw_font_choose() to display a dialog to pick a font.
  * Added dw_box_pack_at_index() like the other dw_box_pack_*() 
    functions except packing at arbitrary locations is possible.
  * Added DW_INT_TO_POINTER/DW_POINTER_TO_INT/etc macros.
  * Fixed gcc warnings on 64bit systems and others.
  * Fixes for loading images from files on Windows and GTK3.

    dw_event_wait().  Please check any code that use these functions.
  * Changed GTK2+ now supports font name styles like the other platforms.
  * Enhanced transparent bitblt on OS/2 and Windows.  OS/2 now supports
    transparent color and Windows now supports 32bit alpha bitblt.
  * Removed thread limits on Windows and GTK using thread local storage.
